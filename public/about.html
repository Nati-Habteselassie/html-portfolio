    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>I am Natnael, a student of Software Engineering at Addis Ababa University. 
        I am curious about how technology does what it does and how it can be used to solve real-life issues. 
        I have learned the fundamentals of programming, data structures, and algorithms from my studies. 
        I push myself beyond the classroom to break and create things in order to learn better.
        I am particularly interested in a mix of low-level systems programming and high-level software design. 
        I prefer optimizing backend performance, trying to understand version control systems like Git, and 
        crafting clean and responsive user interfaces. I dive headfirst into everything software development.
      </p>
      <p>I've already taken fundamental courses such as Database Systems, Data Structures and Algorithms 
        in C++, Object-Oriented Programming, Python Programming, and Fundamentals of Networking. I've also 
        taken mathematically based courses such as Discrete Mathematics and Applied Mathematics I, II, and 
        III. They've given me a solid background both in programming and in more domain-based Software 
        Engineering concepts that I'd like to keep studying.I like clean, readable, and sensible code along 
        with learning for life. I'm currently learning version control internals and web development. I eventually 
        would like to understand how large systems like distributed systems and development tools are built from 
        the ground up.
      </p>
      <p>Aside from technical work, I believe in discipline and consistency. I'm not opposed to fighting 
        with tricky code, reworking the same thing multiple times, or even abandoning a project when it 
        can teach me something valuable. My goal is to be a developer who not only knows how to code but 
        also painstakingly is concerned about how it's done and how it impacts things. My hobbies include 
        playing table tennis, football, and video games to keep active, competitive, and creative.I'm just 
        starting out, but to me, every obstacle, every bug, and every build is a step towards mastery.
      </p>
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>

      <p>I used to play Table Tennis since i was in high-school and i still enjoy playing it on my free time.</p>
      <h3><li>Football</li></h3>

      <p>I also enjoy playing football and the above football field is located in Addis Ababa University. I love playing 
        football there with my friends.
      </p>
      <h3><li>Gaming</li></h3>
      <img src="../assets/images/fifa.jpg" alt="An image of the FIFA football video game" height="300" />
      <p>Above is one of the usual games i play which is the FIFA game series. Since it's very competative it makes it
         very enjoyable and an ideal way to spend time with my friends.
